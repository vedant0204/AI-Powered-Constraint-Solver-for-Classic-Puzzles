# AI-Powered-Constraint-Solver-for-Classic-Puzzles
This Python script is an interactive application that solves three well-known constraint satisfaction problems:

N-Queens Problem – Places N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. It visualizes up to five valid solutions.
Cryptarithmetic Solver – Solves cryptarithmetic puzzles (e.g., SEND + MORE = MONEY) by mapping unique digits to letters using permutations.
Map Coloring Problem – Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve map coloring problems while ensuring that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
The script utilizes:

tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).
matplotlib for visualizing N-Queens and cryptarithmetic solutions.
networkx for solving and displaying graph-based map coloring solutions.
